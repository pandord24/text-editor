# text-editor

## Description

The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.


- My motivation is to learn more about PWA and API.
- I built this project to improve my code writing skill. 
- By applying proper syntax with PWA, it is more organized and easily to identify problems. 
- I learned ways to structure PWA and API.
